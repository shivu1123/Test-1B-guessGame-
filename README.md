# Hangman Game

This is a **Hangman Game** built using **Flutter** and **Provider** for state management. The game allows users to guess the letters of a word and displays whether the guess is correct or not. The game ends when the user has made six wrong guesses or successfully guessed the word.

## Features

- **Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word for the user to guess.
- **Guessing Letters**: Users can guess letters and see if they are correct or not.
- **Wrong Guesses Count**: The game tracks the number of wrong guesses.
- **Game Over State**: The game ends after 6 wrong guesses or when the word is fully guessed.
- **Play Again**: After a game ends, users can play again with a new word.
